# NOTE:
# If you use a reusable workflow (e.g., `uses: ./.github/workflows/.build-application.yml`), 
# you MUST add `secrets: inherit` to the job definition to pass secrets to the called workflow.
# See: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows#passing-inputs-and-secrets-to-a-reusable-workflow

# Example:
# jobs:
#   build:
#     uses: ./.github/workflows/.build-application.yml
#     secrets: inherit
